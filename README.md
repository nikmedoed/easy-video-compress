# Easy Media Compress

A cross-platform, multithreaded Python tool for compressing videos with FFmpeg
and converting photos with Pillow. It works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The
Windows context menu is optional; the CLI and GUI are intended to work on every
supported system.

It supports mixed batches, a drag-and-drop GUI, HEIC photos from Samsung phones
via `pillow-heif`, and two photo conversion modes: visually compressed output
and high-quality conversion close to the original.

## Motivation

Initially, I discovered [rotato](https://tools.rotato.app/compress), which
provided a great in-browser tool for compressing screen recordings. It worked
efficiently, but I had to upload videos one by one and rely on the web
interface. Later, they released a desktop version — but at a steep price. That
didn't appeal to me.

Instead, I turned to the command line and explored FFmpeg's compression
parameters. With the help of GPT, I optimized them and created this script.

Additionally, I needed a way to compress videos under 5 MB to embed them into my
free Notion plan — so I implemented a size-targeting mode as well.

The tool has since grown from a video script into a media tool: it now converts
photos, supports HEIC/HEIF input, has remembered GUI settings, and is split into
small modules under `compress_tool/`.

## What's New

* **Photo conversion** for common formats: JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, WebP, HEIC,
  HEIF, and AVIF.
* **Samsung HEIC support** through `pillow-heif`.
* **Two photo modes**:
  * `lossy`: keeps source resolution, applies EXIF orientation, and saves with
    JPEG/WebP quality 60.
  * `original`: keeps source resolution and saves with JPEG/WebP quality 95;
    JPEG output preserves EXIF/ICC where Pillow supports it.
* **No photo resizing in lossy mode**. Resolution is preserved unless EXIF
  orientation changes width/height by rotating the image.
* **Image output formats**: `jpg`, `png`, `webp`.
* **Mixed-media CLI mode**: videos and photos can be passed together.
* **Image-only CLI mode**: `compress.py image ...`.
* **GUI now accepts images and videos**.
* **GUI remembers settings** for the `5MB video` toggle and `Photo` mode.

## Features

* **Video CRF-based compression**: Adjust the Constant Rate Factor (`-crf`) and
  encoding preset (`-preset`).
* **Video size-based compression**: Target a fixed output size (~4.5 MB) by
  automatically adjusting bitrate and resolution.
* **Photo conversion**: Convert common image formats, including `.heic` and
  `.heif`, to JPEG, PNG, or WebP.
* **Batch processing**: Accept individual files or directories and recursively
  search for supported media.
* **Multithreaded execution**: Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallel processing
  up to 4 workers by default.
* **Rich progress display**: Shows real-time progress bars with estimated time
  remaining.
* **Drag-and-drop GUI**: Launch without arguments or with `--gui`. Files convert
  in parallel with per-file progress and an overall progress bar.
* **Persisted GUI settings**: The GUI remembers the last `5MB video` toggle and
  selected photo mode between launches.
* **Self-contained FFmpeg handling**: Video mode looks for FFmpeg next to the
  app and in `PATH`; when it is missing, the tool can install it through the OS
  package manager.
* **Optional Windows integration**: `.bat` wrapper and PowerShell installer for
  an **Easy Media Compress** Explorer context-menu entry.
* **One-file builds**: PyInstaller builds are available for Windows, macOS, and
  Linux. Builds stay small and use system FFmpeg at runtime.

## Supported Formats

### Videos

`*.mp4`, `*.mkv`, `*.avi`, `*.mov`, `*.flv`, `*.wmv`, `*.webm`

### Images

`*.jpg`, `*.jpeg`, `*.jfif`, `*.png`, `*.bmp`, `*.tif`, `*.tiff`, `*.webp`,
`*.heic`, `*.heif`, `*.avif`

### Image Output Formats

`jpg`, `png`, `webp`

## Requirements

Required on every system:

* **Python 3.10+**
* Python packages from `requirements.txt`

Required for video conversion:

* **FFmpeg and ffprobe**. The tool tries to install them when missing through
  `winget` on Windows, `brew`/`port` on macOS, or `apt-get`, `dnf`, `pacman`,
  `zypper`, or `apk` on Linux.

Required for GUI mode:

* Python `tkinter`
* `tkinterdnd2`
* Native TkDND support for drag-and-drop on systems where the wheel does not
  bundle it correctly

Optional Windows-only integration:

* Windows
* PowerShell
* `win_install.ps1`

## Recommended Usage Model

The author's preferred way to use this project is from source rather than as a
binary bundle. Keeping a local clone plus a virtual environment makes updates
simple: pull the latest changes, update Python dependencies when needed, and
continue using the same scripts, context-menu integration, and settings without
reinstalling the app.

Executable builds are still provided for less technical users who want to
download one file and run it. They contain the Python app and its Python
dependencies, but they do not bundle FFmpeg. When video conversion needs FFmpeg,
the tool first checks the app folder and `PATH`; if FFmpeg is missing, it tries
to install the system package through `winget` on Windows, `brew`/`port` on
macOS, or a supported Linux package manager.

## Installation

1. **Clone or download** this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:

   Windows PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   py -3 -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

   macOS / Linux:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install FFmpeg** manually only if automatic setup is not suitable. The tool
   attempts to call your package manager when FFmpeg is missing.

   Windows:

   ```powershell
   winget install --exact --id Gyan.FFmpeg --source winget
   ```

   macOS:

   ```bash
   brew install ffmpeg
   ```

   Debian / Ubuntu:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install ffmpeg python3-tk
   ```

   Fedora:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install ffmpeg python3-tkinter
   ```

### macOS: TkinterDnD2 setup

Drag-and-drop support on macOS requires the native TkDND library. Install the Python wrapper and place the appropriate binary in the folder used by `tkinterdnd2`:

1. Install the wrapper:
   ```bash
   pip install tkinterdnd2
   ```
2. Download the [TkDND 2.9.5 macOS archive](https://github.com/petasis/tkdnd/releases/tag/tkdnd-release-test-v2.9.5) that matches your CPU (`arm64` or `x86_64`).
3. Extract it and copy the `tkdnd2.9` folder into `.../site-packages/tkinterdnd2/tkdnd/osx-arm64/` (or `osx-x64/`). For a pyenv install of Python 3.13.5:
   ```bash
   cp -R tkdnd2.9.5 ~/.pyenv/versions/3.13.5/lib/python3.13/site-packages/tkinterdnd2/tkdnd/osx-arm64
   ```
4. Verify that TkDND loads:
   ```bash
   python - <<'PY'
   from tkinterdnd2 import TkinterDnD
   root = TkinterDnD.Tk()
   print('tkdnd version:', root.TkdndVersion)
   PY
   ```

### Setup bash / zsh

This is optional, but convenient on macOS and Linux:

```shell
chmod +x compress.py
sudo ln -sf /pathToScript/compress.py /usr/local/bin/compress
```

### Windows Context Menu & PowerShell Integration

This section is Windows-only. The tool itself also works without this installer.

To add an **Easy Media Compress** entry to the right-click menu:

1. **Run** the PowerShell installer as Administrator:

   ```powershell
   .\win_install.ps1
   ```

2. **Restart** Windows Explorer or open a new File Explorer window.

3. **Right-click** any supported media file or folder and choose
   **Easy Media Compress**.

The installer creates a local `.venv`, installs dependencies, ensures FFmpeg
through `winget` when needed, adds a `compress` PowerShell helper, creates a
Start Menu shortcut, and adds the Explorer context-menu entry.

### Build an Executable

To build a one-file executable locally:

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

macOS / Linux:

```bash
python scripts/build.py --install-deps
```

The output is `dist\EasyMediaCompress.exe` on Windows and
`dist/EasyMediaCompress` on macOS/Linux. It is a single universal executable:
running it without arguments opens the GUI, while passing files, folders, or CLI
options runs terminal mode. On Windows, GUI launch detaches from the temporary
console immediately so the GUI does not keep a terminal window open.

Build options:

```powershell
.\build.ps1 -OneDir
.\build.ps1 -Name EasyMediaCompress
```

Builds do not bundle FFmpeg binaries. They use the runtime resolver, which
checks the app folder and `PATH`, then attempts a package-manager install if
FFmpeg is missing.

Packaged builds check GitHub Releases for updates when the GUI starts. The
check is disabled when running from source, so local development never replaces
files. On Windows, the `.exe` downloads the latest `windows-x64.exe` asset,
starts a small PowerShell helper, exits, replaces itself, and relaunches the
GUI. macOS and Linux release assets are detected, but automatic replacement is
not enabled for archive builds yet.

### Release Builds

GitHub Actions builds and publishes release assets automatically when a tag
matching `v*.*.*` is pushed:

* `EasyMediaCompress-<tag>-windows-x64.exe`
* `EasyMediaCompress-<tag>-macos-x64.tar.gz`
* `EasyMediaCompress-<tag>-macos-arm64.tar.gz`
* `EasyMediaCompress-<tag>-linux-x64.tar.gz`

Example:

```powershell
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

Release builds embed the version automatically from the tag name. In GitHub
Actions this comes from `GITHUB_REF_NAME`; local builds use the latest git tag.
If no tag is available, the build falls back to the default version in
`compress_tool/version.py`. You can override it explicitly:

```powershell
python scripts/build.py --version 0.1.0
```

The auto-updater compares the embedded version with the latest GitHub release
tag.

## Troubleshooting

### FFmpeg setup

Video conversion requires `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`. The tool checks the app
folder and `PATH` first. If FFmpeg is missing, it tries to install it with the
native package manager.

Manual install commands:

```powershell
winget install --exact --id Gyan.FFmpeg --source winget
```

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
sudo dnf install ffmpeg
sudo pacman -Sy ffmpeg
sudo zypper install ffmpeg
sudo apk add ffmpeg
```

If there is no internet connection, the automatic install will fail and the
tool will try again the next time video conversion needs FFmpeg.

If `winget`, `brew`, or another supported package manager is unavailable or
blocked by policy, install FFmpeg manually and make sure `ffmpeg` plus
`ffprobe` are available in `PATH`.

On Linux, GUI launches may need elevated privileges to install packages. The
tool tries `pkexec` when a graphical session is available. If that is not
installed, run the tool from a terminal so `sudo` can ask for a password, or
install FFmpeg manually before launching the GUI.

### GUI dependencies

If the GUI does not start because Tkinter or TkDND is missing, install the
platform GUI packages and rerun the app.

Windows:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

macOS:

```bash
brew install python-tk
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Debian / Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-tk
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Packaged release builds include the Python application dependencies, but Linux
desktop environments can still require native Tk/GUI libraries from the OS.
When that happens, install the GUI package for your distribution and run the
app again.

## Usage

### 1. Default Mixed-Media Mode

Compress one or more videos and convert one or more photos. Directories are
searched recursively.

Windows examples:

```powershell
compress.bat video1.mp4 photo1.heic D:\Media
python compress.py video1.mp4 photo1.heic D:\Media -crf 28 -preset fast
python compress.py D:\Photos --image-mode original --image-format jpg
```

macOS / Linux examples:

```bash
python3 compress.py video1.mp4 photo1.heic ~/Media -crf 28 -preset fast
python3 compress.py ~/Photos --image-mode original --image-format jpg
compress ~/Photos --image-mode lossy
```

Videos use CRF mode by default. Images use `lossy` mode by default.

* **`-crf`**: Integer Constant Rate Factor for video (default: 30).
* **`-preset`**: FFmpeg encoding speed preset for video, for example
  `ultrafast`, `fast`, `medium`, `slow` (default: `slow`).
* **`--image-mode`**: `lossy` or `original` (default: `lossy`).
* **`--image-format`**: `jpg`, `png`, or `webp` (default: `jpg`).

Default output names:

* video CRF: `name_compressed.mp4`
* image lossy: `name_compressed.jpg`
* image original: `name_converted.jpg`

### 2. Video Size-Based Mode

Compress videos to a fixed target size (~4.5 MB). Pass `5` as the first
argument:

```bash
python compress.py 5 video1.mp4 /path/to/videos_folder
```

On Windows, the batch wrapper works too:

```powershell
compress.bat 5 video1.mp4 D:\Videos
```

The script calculates the required video bitrate and downscales resolution as
needed to meet the size target. Outputs are named `name_smaller.mp4`.

### 3. Image-Only Mode

Use this when you only want photos processed and do not want video inputs
considered.

```bash
python compress.py image /path/to/photos --mode lossy
python compress.py image /path/to/photos --mode original --format jpg
python compress.py photo IMG_001.heic --mode original --format webp
```

On systems where the executable is `python3`, use `python3` instead of `python`.

Image modes:

* **`lossy`**: Keeps source resolution, applies EXIF orientation, and saves with
  JPEG/WebP quality 60.
* **`original`**: Keeps source resolution and saves with JPEG/WebP quality 95;
  JPEG output preserves EXIF/ICC where Pillow supports it.

Image output behavior:

* JPEG output flattens alpha onto a white background.
* PNG output is optimized and preserves alpha when possible.
* WebP output uses quality 60 in `lossy` mode and quality 95 in `original`
  mode.
* Source files are not deleted.

### 4. GUI Mode

Launch the script without any arguments or pass `--gui`:

```bash
python compress.py
python compress.py --gui
```

On macOS / Linux, use `python3` if that is your Python command:

```bash
python3 compress.py --gui
```

Drop multiple videos or images onto the window or use the **Add Media** button.
Conversion begins immediately in parallel threads. Each row displays per-file
progress, and the top bar shows overall progress.

GUI controls:

* **5MB video**: Toggles video size-targeting mode for newly added videos.
* **Photo**: Selects `lossy` or `original` for newly added images.
* **`<>` column**: Enqueues the same file again with the alternate mode.
* Double-click a row to open the source file's folder.

The GUI remembers the last `5MB video` and `Photo` settings between launches.

Persisted settings paths:

* Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EasyMediaCompress\settings.json`
* macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/EasyMediaCompress/settings.json`
* Linux: `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/easy-media-compress/settings.json` or
  `~/.config/easy-media-compress/settings.json`

## Useful Files

* **`compress.py`**: Main entry point for CLI and GUI usage.
* **`compress.bat`**: Windows batch wrapper for console mode.
* **`launch_gui.vbs`**: Windows helper to start the GUI without a console
  window.
* **`win_install.ps1`**: Windows-only PowerShell installer for context-menu
  hooks, dependencies, and Start Menu shortcuts.
* **`build.ps1`**: Windows wrapper for the PyInstaller build script.
* **`scripts/build.py`**: Cross-platform PyInstaller build script for one-file
  executables.
* **`requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies.
* **`requirements-build.txt`**: PyInstaller build dependency.

## Notes

* Video work requires FFmpeg and ffprobe; the tool can invoke supported package
  managers when they are not already installed.
* Image-only work does not require FFmpeg.
* HEIC/HEIF support depends on `pillow-heif`.
* AVIF support depends on the installed Pillow build.
* The Windows context menu is optional and does not affect macOS or Linux usage.
